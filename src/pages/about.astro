      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Harauld Sextus, Iâ€™m a French photographer based in Huahin thailand.
        <br />
        <br />I specialize in shooting architecture, interiors, hotels,
        corporate and industrial reportage as well as landscape photography.
        <br />
        <br />A life of travels has made me flexible in a wide variety of
        situations and able to achieve results in all sorts of challenging
        environements. Clients have trusted me on hundreds of assignments in
        over 35 countries during the past decade.
        <br />
        <br />On my free time I enjoy travelling off the beaten path and
        exploring urban spaces, as well as hiking in nature. I also like a cold
        beer.
        <br />
